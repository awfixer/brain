# How these pages work

so the pages are .mdx files, and this one is located [here]

in each MDX file the first thing that you have is what is called the frontmatter, which is what allows me to tell you the title, description, and other basic info (like the author card ill be adding soon).

### Links

Then you have the links section, which is where I add all the links that I use in the posts so that i am not always typing out `[here](https://this.link)`, which gets old after a while.

# Sentry

You then have the magic [Sentry] configuration

```Typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "*",

  tracesSampleRate: 1,

  enableLogs: true,

  sendDefaultPii: true,
});
```
