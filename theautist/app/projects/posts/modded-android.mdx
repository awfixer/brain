# Modded Android

## What is [Modded Android]?

modded android is a spiritial successor to the Android Platform. It is based on the Android 14 edition of the codebase.

There are several goals of [Modded Android], and they are based on various things that I want to achieve, as well as some things that I have seen in the communties that I choose to participate in.

### Goal 1: Create a Usable System

This is a goal that is inspired by a quote that I read over on [Sourcehut].

"we know this looks like a full, usable system, this is alpha quality software to us."

I read this and I understand what they mean by this. Though it is also true that if you do some research into how their software runs, behind the scenes it is definately alpha quality, it is a really cool front end though - I will give them that.

The point is that even after a first edition of Modded Android is released to emulators (as it will require custom hardware, we are going to refuse to use the proprietary hardware stacks that companies like [Google] and [Samsung] offer)

### Goal 2: Prioritze the Commmunity, not the company.

One thing that I have very firm beliefs about is that the reason capitalism fails, is not because it is a bad thing. It is really really good. It fails because of things like Feduciary Corruption, the fact that they are all LLCs, S Corps, and C Corps, and they value money above all else.

The idea that one needs to make money is [bad], though that is something I explain in my blog post if you want to know. The real point here is that companies do their best to make money, and it often comes at the expense of the consumers saftey, rights, and livlihood. We aim to be different. The core of our model is the customer, and we plan on keeping it that way.
