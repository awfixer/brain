[Notion]: https://notion.so
### This is my second brain.

there are a lot of things in here, such as the blog, a website, some projects etc, etc. I store some of the things I do not want open on the internet in my [Notion]. Things like my Telos file and personal goals are not for public eyes :)

I use Claude and Gemini in here a lot, allowing me to delegate things while I work on projects that help pay the bills. The way that I use Claude and Gemini is more detailed and advanced then other people, so you can expect there to be things in here like a CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md file per directory which allows them to have context of everything rather than a broad overview. There are also .claude and .gemini directories where I store agents, commands, and their settings for this project.

I also use fabric for parts of this as it allows me to save time and find more context out of things than one traditionally would get.
